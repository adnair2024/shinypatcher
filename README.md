A sophisticated, web-based ROM patching utility designed to modify shiny encounter probabilities in Generation 3 (GBA) and Generation 4 (NDS) Pokémon games. Featuring a nostalgic **HGSS Pokedex-inspired interface** with modern glassmorphism.

## ✨ Features

*   **Retro Aesthetics:** Beautiful UI inspired by the HeartGold/SoulSilver Pokedex, utilizing glassmorphism and pixel-perfect details.
*   **Intelligent Patching:** Automatically identifies ROM types (GBA vs NDS) and applies the correct hexadecimal offset.
*   **Batch Processing:** Upload a `.zip` archive containing multiple ROMs; the tool will process them all and return a single patched archive.
*   **Live Probability Calculator:** Real-time conversion between "Human Readable Odds" (e.g., 1/256) and the internal Hexadecimal threshold.
*   **Safe Handling:** Uses temporary session-based processing to ensure your original files aren't overwritten locally.

## 🛠️ Technical Breakdown

In the original Pokémon engine, a "Shiny" encounter is determined by a XOR calculation of the Trainer ID, Secret ID, and the Pokémon's Personality Value (PID). If the result is less than a specific **Threshold**, the Pokémon is shiny.

*   **Standard Odds:** Threshold = `8` (8/65536 ≈ 1/8192)
*   **Max Odds (Single Byte):** Threshold = `255` (255/65536 ≈ 1/257)

This tool patches the `CMP` (Compare) instruction in the game's assembly to use your custom threshold.
